This directory contains the course project for 
Getting and Cleaning Data from Coursera. It contains the following files for working with and cleaning a dataset collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphones:

## 1. README.md

## 2. run_analysis.R

This is a R script that does the following.
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The output of this script is the tidy dataset, tidy.txt

## 3. CodeBook.md

This file contains infomration on all variables, calculations, and transformations, relevant to understanding the output of run_analysis.R, which is the file tidy.txt.
